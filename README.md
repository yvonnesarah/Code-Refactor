# Code-Refactor

## Description

Hired by the Marketing Manager to refactor their page - Horiseon, Social Solution Services.
Task to improve their existing codebase to ensure it is more accessible and optimized. 

Prior to taking on this project, the website had broken links. There were several elements in the HTML and CSS file that needed to be repaired. The following changes were put in place to achieve the Marketing Managers criteria:

- Updated the title of the webpage to read 'Horiseon | Social Solution Services'.
- Meta viewport tag added to allow users to be able to see from any device or monitor, reaching our to a wider audience.
- HTML elements and Heading attributes follow a logical structure.
- Image and icon elements contain descriptive 'alt' attributes allowing users to know what the picture or icon is incase these fail to load at any point in time.
- All links in the navigation bar and the letters 'seo' in 'Horiseon' in the main header are functioning correctly.
- All div's were replaced with semantic elements.
- Comments added to both HTML and CSS to allow other developers to understand the changes.
- Quality README was created.
